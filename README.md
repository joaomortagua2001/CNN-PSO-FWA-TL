## 🚀 Project Goals

The project was developed in three main phases, each focused on improving the classification model:

### 📌 Phase 1: Initial Classifier Development
In this first phase, we built a **convolutional neural network (CNN)** capable of identifying different types of waste from images. The model was trained on a dataset containing various waste categories, serving as an initial approach to the classification problem.

### 📌 Phase 2: Hyperparameter Optimization with FWA and PSO
To improve the model's **accuracy**, we optimized its hyperparameters using two population-based optimization algorithms:
- **Fireworks Algorithm (FWA)** 🔥🎆 – inspired by the explosion patterns of fireworks to explore and search for optimal solutions.
- **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** 🐦✨ – based on the collective behavior of swarms to find better hyperparameter combinations.

This phase resulted in a more efficient model with enhanced performance.

### 📌 Phase 3: Transfer Learning and a New Optimization Approach
To further boost the model’s performance, we implemented:
- **Transfer Learning** 🧠📚 – leveraging pre-trained networks to enhance the model’s generalization capabilities.
- **PSO and Random Search** 🎲💡 – combining **PSO optimization** with **random hyperparameter selection** to explore a broader range of possibilities.

This final stage led to significant improvements in accuracy and robustness.

## 📊 Results and Impact
With the optimizations applied, our model achieved higher accuracy rates, making it a more efficient solution for automatic waste classification. These advancements can be utilized in automated sorting systems, contributing to a more sustainable environment. 🌍♻️
